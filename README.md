## üßêAbout

Due to personal and family medical issues I unfortunately had to step away from programming for the last year. I dabbled when the opportunity arose but was unable to stay consistent. I'm happy to say that this chapter of my life is now behind me. I decided to complete React.js course I found on Scrimba in order to refresh my React skills. Quizzical is the final solo project from this course. Quizzical utilizes the Open Trivia Database API. I love video games so this category was an obvious choice.
